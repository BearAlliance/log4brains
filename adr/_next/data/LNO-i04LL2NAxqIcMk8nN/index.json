That way, you can get an idea of the whole project history just by reading its decision log in chronological order.\n\nTo get more information:\n\n- [ADR GitHub organization](https://adr.github.io/)\n- [What is an ADR and why should you use them](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master#-what-is-an-adr-and-why-should-you-use-them)\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThis website is automatically updated after a change on the `master` branch of the Git repository of this project.\nIn fact, the developers manage this documentation directly with markdown files located next to their code, so it is more convenient for them to keep it up-to-date.\nYou can browse the ADRs by using the left menu or the search bar.\n\nThe typical workflow of an ADR is the following:\n\n![ADR workflow](adr-workflow.png)\n\n<br /><br />\n\nFor more information, please have a look at the [Log4brains documentation](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master#readme), which is used to generate this documentation.\n","l4bVersion":"1.0.0-alpha.20"},"__N_SSG":true}
