# Architecture knowledge base

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the architecture knowledge base of Log4brains.
You will find here all the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) of the project.

## What is an ADR?

> An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.
> An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitutes its decision log.

An ADR is immutable, only its status can change (ie. it can become deprecated or superseded). That way, you can get an idea of the whole project history just by reading its decision log in chronological order.

To get more information:

- [ADR GitHub organization](https://adr.github.io/)
- [What is an ADR and why should you use them](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master#-what-is-an-adr-and-why-should-you-use-them)

## How does it work?

This website is automatically updated after a change on the `master` branch of the Git repository of this project.
In fact, the developers manage this documentation directly with markdown files located next to their code, so it is more convenient for them to keep it up-to-date.
You can browse the ADRs by using the left menu or the search bar.

The typical workflow of an ADR is the following:
