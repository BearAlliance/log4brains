# Architecture knowledge base

Welcome to the project architecture knowledge base.
This website tracks architecture decisions (also known as [ADR - Architecture Decision Record](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html)), in a chronological order.

Every ADR has one of these statuses:

- Draft
- Proposed
- Accepted
- Rejected
- Superseded
- Deprecated
