As mentioned in [20200925-multi-packages-architecture-in-a-monorepo-with-yarn-and-lerna](../../../../docs/adr/20200925-multi-packages-architecture-in-a-monorepo-with-yarn-and-lerna.md), we want the core API to be well-tested because all the business logic will happen here.

Herberto Gra√ßa did an awesome job but by putting together all the best practices of DDD, hexagonal architecture, onion architecture, clean architecture, CQRS... in what he calls [Explicit Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/tag/explicit-architecture/).
We will use this architecture for our core package.
